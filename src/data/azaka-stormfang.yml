description: |
  Azaka (NG female Chultan human **weretiger**) works out of Port Nyanzaru. She conceals her lycanthropy from the characters for as long as possible and will guide adventurers for free if they agree to help her retrieve an item that was stolen by the pterafolk of Firefinger. If questioned about the stolen item, Azaka responds only that it’s a family heirloom: a wooden mask carved to resemble a tiger’s face. It is actually a _**mask of the beast**_ (see appendix C).

  Azaka has wandered far and wide through the jungle in tiger form. She is acquainted with Saja N’baza, the powerful and wise guardian naga of Orolunga, and gladly leads characters to the naga if they’re looking for guidance.

  Azaka stands 6 feet tall and weighs about 150 pounds. She will not willingly spread her lycanthropic curse. She is also afraid of heights and will not willingly put herself in a situation in which she’s in danger of falling more than 60 feet. Azaka’s damage immunities do not protect her against damage from falling.
