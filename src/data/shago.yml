  Shago (CG male Chultan **gladiator** with Survival +7) is a Chultan and the only son of Zhanthi, one of Port Nyanzaru’s merchant princes. He works out of Fort Beluarian, and although he presents himself as an independent operator, he’s in league with the Flaming Fist. Shago has led many Flaming Fist expeditions into the jungle to clear out undead, despite having a great fear of being turned into a zombie or ghoul.

  Despite his fears, Shago knows that the undead must be defeated. This is why he works with the Flaming Fist; the merchant princes bemoan the threat from undead but, other than hiring guards to defend Port Nyanzaru, they won’t pay to take effective action against it. His mother believes she’s “recruited” him to keep an eye on the Flaming Fist, but his sympathies are with the mercenaries and he rarely provides her with any secret or useful information.

  Shago is 6 feet 3 inches tall and 220 pounds, with rippling muscles and a friendly smile. His main goal is to impress Liara Portyr enough to earn a rank within the Flaming Fist. While Shago is their guide, characters gain advantage on Charisma checks made to influence members of the Flaming Fist.
